# angular-todo
A simple angular 1.x todo list.

The main goal for this project was to develop a small angular app that properly followed the [Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md). Even though Angular 1.x isn't the "new hotness" in web development, at the time of this writing, it's still used in many places, and even still being used for development. Hopefully, this app can be an example and resource for those still developing with Angular 1.x!

Please let me know if you find any bugs or ways that this app doesn't follow the style guide! I worked on this slowly over time, as a fun simple side project.

Want to see it in action? Here's the [demo](http://www.coltonhurst.com/angular-todo) on my website.
