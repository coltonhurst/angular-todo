# angular-todo
A simple angular 1.x todo list.

This project is still in development. I'm just slowly adding to it here and there.

Even though Angular 1.x isn't the "new hotness", it's still in use all over the place. This app hopefully is a good example of what an angular 1.x spa should look like.

This simple app's goal is to follow the Angular 1 style guide, which can be found [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).
